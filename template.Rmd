it can also be a pdf/word document (the "output" section above)

I'm an R Markdown document! 

# Section 1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:

```{r}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2

####This is a sub title

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.

```{r plot example} 
#the code above gives the code chunk name
library(tidyverse)
plot_df = tibble(
  x = rnorm(500, mean = 2, sd = 4),
  y = 3 - 4.2*x + rnorm(500)
)

ggplot(plot_df,aes(x=x,y=y)) + geom_point()


```

Here is a list:
